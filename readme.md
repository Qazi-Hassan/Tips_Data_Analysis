# Tips for Data Analysis Report

This repository contains a collection of tips and best practices for writing effective data analysis reports. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced analyst, these guidelines will help you communicate your findings clearly and professionally.

## Installation by creating a python virtual environment

To get started, you can create a Python environment and install the necessary packages. Follow these steps:

```bash
# Create a new Python virtual environment
python -m venv data_analysis_venv
# Activate the virtual environment
source data_analysis_venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `data_analysis_venv\Scripts\activate`
```

## create a requirements.txt file and add libraries inside

## requirements.txt

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly

## Then install the required packages

pip install -r requirements.txt

## another way to install packages

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly ipykernel openpyxl

## create a jupyter notebook

```bash
# create a ipynb file
mkdir scripts
cd scripts
touch data_analysis_report.ipynb
```

### 2.1. use of github copilot or chatgpt for data analysis report and to write code faster

Here id the first prompt no.1:

> `ave df in this notebook, which is tips data. act as a data analyst, and write the code using python libraries pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and plot , to do the basic data analytics tasks such as:

1. data composition report
2. data distribution report
3. data comparison report
4. data relationship report

if you need to do the statistics please install stats models and scipy libraries using code cells in jupyter notebook.

if you want to create a plot and whenever you do that, please interpret the result as t would like to submit that in a report form lets see what you have got,  i am really looking forward to your code without bugs and best possible plots.`
